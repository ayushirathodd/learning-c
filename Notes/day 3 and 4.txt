DAY-3:

3 types of instructions in C:-
a] type declaration ins:
to declare the type of variables in a C program.
any var used in the program must be declared before using it in any statement.
type declaration written in beginning of main() func
eg. int bas;
char name,code;
1) int i=10,j=25;
2)float a=1.5,b=a+3.1; right
float b=a+3.1,a=1.5; wrong coz using a before even defining it
3)int a,b,c,d;
int a=b=c=10; right
int a=b=c=d=10; not coz "
b] arithmetic ins:
to perform arithmetic operations bw constants nd variables.
var name on left= and var name&cons on right(connected by arth oper + - *)

VAR AND CONS TOGETHER ARE CALLED OPERANDS

C arth stm 3 types=
1: real mode: all operands are either real cons or real var
2: int mode: " " " " int var or int cons
3: mixed mode: some of operands are int nd some are real.

rules:
a= only 1 var on left side .eg.z=k+l
b= / used for dividing %modular opt for remainder (not apply on float) eg. 10/2 yields 5 and 10%2 yields 0
    						" remainder sign as numerator's
c= storing char cons in cons var. 
eg. char a,b,d; 
a='F';
b='G';
d='+';
as per ASCII F=70 ND G=71
d=arth opt can be perform on ints,floats and chars.
eg. char x,y;
int z;
x='a';
y='b';
z=x+y;
as per ASCII a=97 nd b=98 so it can be added
e=no operator is assumed to be present , must be written explicitly
eg. a=c.d.b(xy) usual arth stmt
b=c*d*b*(x*y) c stmt (* after b must be explicitly written)
f=no operator for performing exonentiation opt
eg. a=3**2;
b=3^2;  wrong
#include<math.h>   used for pow() to work
{
	int a;
	a=pow(3,2);
	printf("%d",a);
}
pow() is used as raise 3 power of 2
g=modular division operator %


DAY 4=
INT ND FLOAT CONVERSIONS=
(a):  arth opt bw int nd int alwys result int
(b): "" real and real "" real
(c): "" int and real "" real


TYPE CONVERSION IN ASSIGNMENTS=
when the type of expression or var on the left side of assign oper is not same , 
in such case vale of ex" is promoted or demoted depending on the type of var on left side.

float: real num
int: int
(c): "" int and real "" real
so opt bw float nd int result=float but when float is assigned to s it is again demoted to an int and then stored in s.

HIERARCHY OF OPERATIONS=
the priority or precedence in which the operations in an arth stmt are performed is called ".
1st priority= * / % =multi,div,modular div
2nd "         = + -      =add,sub
3rd "         = =        =assign
  eg. on pg 33,34 lc


ASSOCIATIVITY OF OPERATORS= ///
when an expression contains 2 operators of equal priority the tie bw them is settled using the associativity of the operators. 
asso 2 types:
left to right =
left operand must be unambiguous= it must not be involved in evaluation of any other sub expression
right to left =
right ""

eg. 3/2*5;   
																								
c]control ins:
to control the seq of execution of various statements in a C program.
4 types:
1] seq control ins=
ins are executed in same order in which they appear in program
2]selection or decision ""=
allow comp to take decision as to which ins is to be executed next.
3]repetition or loop ""=
helps comp to execute a grp of stmts repeatedly
4]case ""= 
same as point 2]
